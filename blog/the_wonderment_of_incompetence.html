    <h1>The Wonderment of Incompetence
</h2>
    <p>November 07, 2012</p>
    <p>It isn't often that someone screws up this royally, but in a stroke of superior
incompetence, I was able to make a backup of this blog's database, then make a
backup of this site's content (in preparation for a server move) only to then
delete both backups somehow, as well as cancelling the hosting for the site 
that they were on. </p>
<p>I've often treated this blog as second-class, so it's not really any surprise
(to me) that I was able to screw it up, but what is surprising is that I had 
specifically planned against it, and perhaps just to having so much going on, 
was able to unravel said plans pretty fantastically. </p>
<p>Regardless, the point isn't to moan and whine about that as much as it is to 
explain where all the content went.  I've gotten emails asking about articles, 
and in particular, the "Extremely Gentle Introduction" series, and I no longer
have them.  I'll likely get around to rewriting them based on the excerpts I've 
got, but if anybody is aware of full content caches of either the site, or those
articles in particular, please point them my way as I would LOVE to get them 
back up and running. </p>
<p>I did find a backup of the "Extremely Gentle Introduction to Meteor", and have 
reposted it, but that's hardly the entire content of the site.  </p>
<p>In completely related news, the blog is now one of those new fancy static blogs
(using a modified version of <a href="https://github.com/dz/chisel">Chisel</a> for the 
moment), and content is versioned with Git, and backed up to Github.  Apologies 
for the massive inconvenience, and I'll try harder to at least preserve the 
content here in the future. </p>
