    <h1>An Extremely Gentle Introduction to Meteor
</h2>
    <p>November 07, 2012</p>
    <p>As I mentioned in <a href="http://sympodial.com/blog/javascript-meteor-future/" target="_blank">an earlier post</a>,
there's a new dynamic Javascript framework on the block, <a target="_blank">Meteor</a>.  I've had some time to play with
it now, and I've seen a myriad of comments and questions in the #Meteor room on freenode, so I thought I'd share my
progress thus far. </p>
<p>There's quite a bit of controversy regarding Meteor at the moment.  <a href="http://nodejs.org/"
target="_blank">Node.js</a> purists seem to be complaining that Meteor doesn't leverage <a href="http://npmjs.org/"
target="_blank">NPM</a>, that it uses <a href="https://github.com/laverdet/node-fibers" target="_blank">Node-Fibers</a>,
instead of the typical asynchronous style of Node, that it's licensed with GPL, versus a more permissive
attribution-style license.  </p>
<p>The first two issues are, frankly, over my head.  I mean, I can point you at the <a href="http://docs.meteor.com/"
target="_blank">Meteor docs</a>, where they indicate that "the linear execution model a better fit for the typical
server code in a Meteor application", or that the Meteor 'Smart Packages' are far more approachable than NPM, but as
I've said, I'm a relative newcomer to Javascript on the server, so my opinion wouldn't be that well formed.  As for the
license, that is of course for you to determine on your own whether the fit is appropriate. </p>
<p>I could also point out that <a href="http://meteor.com/about/people" target="_blank">the Meteor team</a> has some
serious street cred, and that despite what appears to be an entire community yelling at how they're <em>doing it all
wrong&trade;</em>, one might be willing to put their faith in the technical prowess of the team.  If you're an
experienced Node developer, you almost certainly have a more informed opinion than mine.  </p>
<p>What I can say with certainty though, is that even though this is a <strong>very</strong> early release of their
product, I've been able to do things in Javascript I've never been able to before.  In writing the very early parts of
<a href="http://github.com/bmelton/Orbvt" target="_blank">Orbvt</a>, I've had a lot of ups and downs in understanding
the framework, and some of its incompleteness has bitten me in the ass (it is only at a .3.4preview status, after all),
but the amount of code that I have NOT had to write is what makes it shine. </p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>To start playing with Meteor, you can run the following (on supported operating systems) <span class="code">curl
install.meteor.com | sh</span>.  On OSX Lion, this ran flawlessly.  In the IRC channel, a common issue arose for users
already running a Mongo database causing problems.  If so, you can override which Mongo instance your app uses with an
environment variable.  <span class="code">export MONGO_URL=mongodb://user.password@host:port/databasename</span> where
host is <em>probably</em> localhost, and port is <em>probably</em> 27017.  </p>
<p>To create a new application, <span class="code">meteor create <em>meteor-intro</em></span> will get you started.  <span
class="code">cd meteor-intro</span> into your new app folder.  To start the app that's there, just run <span
class="code">meteor</span>, then open up a browser and visit <span class="code">localhost:3000</span>.  You should see a
"Hello World!" page with a button.  Clicking the button logs an entry into your browser's Javascript console (which you
should open to see.)</p>
<p>So far, the hardest part has been reading all my wordy ranting in this blog post.  If you wanted, we could now open a
new console window (so as not to interrupt our server) for file editing (or use your text editor of choice).  Inside our
meteor-intro folder, we have three files (and one hidden <span class="code">.meteor</span> folder,) meteor-intro.css,
meteor-intro.html and meteor-intro.js.  </p>
<p>If we look at the meteor-intro.js file in a text editor, we'll see this: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2384744.js"> </script></p>
<p>Probably the first Meteor-specific thing we need to show here are the <span class="code">if (Meteor.is_client)</span>
and <span class="code">if (Meteor.is_server)</span> blocks.  As we know, Meteor is based on Node, so we're using
Javascript as both the front and backend languages.  In this one-file paradigm that we've started with, we can have both
components be served by the same file.  </p>
<p>You might put your database methods, or authorization code on the 'is_server' side, and similarly you would probably not
want to render the end user's templates from the client side.  Though those of those <em>can</em> possibly be done from
either location, we'll try to do what makes sense. </p>
<p>It's worth noting that you could create a "server" folder to store server code in, and a "client" folder to store client
code in as well, but you don't necessarily need to for smallish apps.  As the application grows larger, we may migrate
from the 'one-page' design into something more structured, but Meteor allows for both. </p>
<p>Now that we understand that, the first line of real code is the <span class="code">Template.hello.greeting</span> line.
Meteor uses <a href="http://mustachejs.org/" target="_blank">Mustache Templates</a>, and this line (along with some
backend Meteor magic) binds a Template item to a function, and also binds an 'Observer' to that function.  We'll get to
more about what that means later, but put simply, an Observer watches the function and does <em>something</em> when the
result of the function changes.  In this case, it will re-render our template, which is pretty magical. </p>
<p>If we take a brief look at the accompanying <span class="code">meteor-intro.html</span> file, we'll see the Template
we're talking to: 
<script src="https://gist.github.com/2385010.js"> </script></p>
<p>That's it there.  Looking back at our JS, you'll see that the <span class="code">Template.hello.greeting</span> is
mapping to a Template, named 'hello', with a 'greeting' variable.  The 'greeting' might also have been an object, which
would require some more special handling in the Template HTML code, but it's about as straightforward as you'd expect.
Not having worked with Mustache before, this was confusing to me at first, so don't feel horrible if it takes a few
tries to 'get it'.  (If it takes less, feel free to gloat about how much smarter you are than me.  I'm used to it.)</p>
<p>The next bit of code <span class="code">Template.hello.events</span> binds event listeners to the "hello" Template.
This is similar to how <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone</a> handles events, so if you're familiar with that,
you should be hip here.  If not, it's easily explained, though I don't know what events are supported out of the box: 
<span class="code">"click input"</span> means that we're binding the 'click' event on 'input' selectors to the function
we define (which, in this case, appends to console.log).  If we wanted to bind a link, it would instead be <span
class="code">"click a"</span> or <span class="code">"click a.new_link"</span>, where 'new_link' is a class name.)</p>
<p>We could, of course, also bind to spans, divs, classes or IDs as well.  The events appear to be jQuery events, and
should support all jQuery event types, though I haven't tested that.  You could bind 'keyup', 'keydown', 'mouseover',
etc.</p>
<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>That pretty much sums up the anatomy of the intro project.  In our next run, we'll look at inserting and querying the
Mongo data store, looping through record sets with Mustache, and perhaps even working with Route handlers to create new
screens in our application.  </p>
